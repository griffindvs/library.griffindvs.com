## About
This webapp is built with [React](https://reactjs.org/) using [CreateReactApp](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started), [Reactstrap](https://reactstrap.github.io/), and [FontAwesome Icons](https://fontawesome.com/). The [hosting](https://firebase.google.com/products/hosting/), [database](https://firebase.google.com/products/firestore/), and [authentication](https://firebase.google.com/products/auth/) are provided through [Google Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/).

The application is currently in development, and requires a number of fixes listed on the issues page. Once it is complete, its purpose will be to catalog books that Griffin has read recently. I hope to add search and filtering functions in the future.

## Building the App
1. Install [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/)
2. Navigate to the main directory in a terminal
3. Serve the site to see changes during development
   - Run `npm start`
   - The site will be live at [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)
4. Build the site for deployment
   - Run `npm run build`
   - The built site can be found in the `build` folder
